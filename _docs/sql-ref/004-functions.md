You can use the following types of functions in your Drill queries:

  * [Math and Trig](/docs/math-and-trig/)
  * [Data Type Conversion](/docs/data-type-conversion/)
  * [Date/Time and Arithmetic](/docs/date-time-functions-and-arithmetic/)
  * [String Manipulation](/docs/string-manipulation)
  * [Aggregate and Aggregate Statistical](/docs/aggregate-and-aggregate-statistical)
  * [Nested Data](/docs/nested-data-functions/)
  * [Functions for Handling Nulls](/docs/functions-for-handling-nulls)

You need to use a FROM clause in Drill queries. Examples in this documentation often use `FROM sys.version` in the query for example purposes.
