REPEATED CONTAINS searches for a keyword in an array. 

## Syntax

    REPEATED_CONTAINS(array_name, keyword)

* array_name is a simple array, such as topping:

		{
		. . .
		    "topping":
		        [
		            "None",
		            "Glazed",
		            "Sugar",
		            "Powdered Sugar",
		            "Chocolate with Sprinkles",
		            "Chocolate",
		            "Maple"
		        ]
		}

* keyword is a value in the array, such as 'Glazed'.

## Usage Notes
REPEATED_CONTAINS returns true if Drill finds a match; otherwise, the function returns false. The function supports regular expression wildcards, but not at the beginning of the keyword:

* Asterisk (*)
* Period (.)
* Question mark (?)
* Square bracketed ranges [a-z]
* Square bracketed characters [ch]
* Negated square bracketed ranges or characters [!ch].

Enclose keyword string values in single quotation marks. Do not enclose numerical keyword values in single quotation marks.
