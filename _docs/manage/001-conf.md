Drill provides several configuration options that you can enable, disable, or
modify. Modifying certain configuration options can impact Drillâ€™s
performance. Many of Drill's configuration options reside in the `drill-
env.sh` and `drill-override.conf` files. Drill stores these files in the
`/conf` directory. Drill sources` /etc/drill/conf` if it exists. Otherwise,
Drill sources the local `<drill_installation_directory>/conf` directory.

Refer to the following documentation for information about configuration
options that you can modify:
