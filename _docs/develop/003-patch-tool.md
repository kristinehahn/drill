### Drill JIRA and Reviewboard script

#### 1\. Setup

  1. Follow instructions [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/Drill+Patch+Review+Tool#Drillpatchreviewtool-JIRAcommandlinetool) to setup the jira-python package
  2. Follow instructions [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/Drill+Patch+Review+Tool#Drillpatchreviewtool-Reviewboard) to setup the reviewboard python tools
  3. Install the argparse module 
  
        On Linux -> sudo yum install python-argparse
        On Mac -> sudo easy_install argparse

#### 2\. Usage

	nnarkhed-mn: nnarkhed$ python drill-patch-review.py --help
	usage: drill-patch-review.py [-h] -b BRANCH -j JIRA [-s SUMMARY]
	                             [-d DESCRIPTION] [-r REVIEWBOARD] [-t TESTING]
	                             [-v VERSION] [-db] -rbu REVIEWBOARDUSER -rbp REVIEWBOARDPASSWORD
	 
	Drill patch review tool
	 
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -b BRANCH, --branch BRANCH
	                        Tracking branch to create diff against
	  -j JIRA, --jira JIRA  JIRA corresponding to the reviewboard
	  -s SUMMARY, --summary SUMMARY
	                        Summary for the reviewboard
	  -d DESCRIPTION, --description DESCRIPTION
	                        Description for reviewboard
	  -r REVIEWBOARD, --rb REVIEWBOARD
	                        Review board that needs to be updated
	  -t TESTING, --testing-done TESTING
	                        Text for the Testing Done section of the reviewboard
	  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
	                        Version of the patch
	  -db, --debug          Enable debug mode
	  -rbu, --reviewboard-user Reviewboard user name
	  -rbp, --reviewboard-password Reviewboard password

#### 3\. Upload patch

  1. Specify the branch against which the patch should be created (-b)
  2. Specify the corresponding JIRA (-j)
  3. Specify an **optional** summary (-s) and description (-d) for the reviewboard

Example:

    python drill-patch-review.py -b origin/master -j DRILL-241 -rbu tnachen -rbp password

#### 4\. Update patch

  1. Specify the branch against which the patch should be created (-b)
  2. Specify the corresponding JIRA (--jira)
  3. Specify the rb to be updated (-r)
  4. Specify an **optional** summary (-s) and description (-d) for the reviewboard, if you want to update it
  5. Specify an **optional** version of the patch. This will be appended to the jira to create a file named JIRA-<version>.patch. The purpose is to be able to upload multiple patches to the JIRA. This has no bearing on the reviewboard update.

Example:

    python drill-patch-review.py -b origin/master -j DRILL-241 -r 14081 rbp tnachen -rbp password

### JIRA command line tool

#### 1\. Download the JIRA command line package

Install the jira-python package.

    sudo easy_install jira-python

#### 2\. Configure JIRA username and password

Include a jira.ini file in your $HOME directory that contains your Apache JIRA
username and password.

	nnarkhed-mn:~ nnarkhed$ cat ~/jira.ini
	user=nehanarkhede
	password=***********

### Reviewboard

This is a quick tutorial on using [Review Board](https://reviews.apache.org)
with Drill.

#### 1\. Install the post-review tool

If you are on RHEL, Fedora or CentOS, follow these steps:

	sudo yum install python-setuptools
	sudo easy_install -U RBTools

If you are on Mac, follow these steps:

	sudo easy_install -U setuptools
	sudo easy_install -U RBTools

For other platforms, follow the [instructions](http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/dev/users/tools/post-review/) to
setup the post-review tool.

#### 2\. Configure Stuff

Then you need to configure a few things to make it work.

First set the review board url to use. You can do this from in git:

    git config reviewboard.url https://reviews.apache.org

If you checked out using the git wip http url that confusingly won't work with
review board. So you need to configure an override to use the non-http url.
You can do this by adding a config file like this:

	jkreps$ cat ~/.reviewboardrc
	REPOSITORY = 'git://git.apache.org/incubator-drill.git'
	TARGET_GROUPS = 'drill-git'
GUESS_FIELDS = True



### FAQ

#### When I run the script, it throws the following error and exits

    nnarkhed$python drill-patch-review.py -b trunk -j DRILL-241
    There don't seem to be any diffs

There are two reasons for this:

  * The code is not checked into your local branch
  * The -b branch is not pointing to the remote branch. In the example above, "trunk" is specified as the branch, which is the local branch. The correct value for the -b (--branch) option is the remote branch. "git branch -r" gives the list of the remote branch names.

#### When I run the script, it throws the following error and exits

Error uploading diff
 
Your review request still exists, but the diff is not attached.

One of the most common root causes of this error are that the git remote
branches are not up-to-date. Since the script already does that, it is
probably due to some other problem. You can run the script with the --debug
option that will make post-review run in the debug mode and list the root
cause of the issue.
