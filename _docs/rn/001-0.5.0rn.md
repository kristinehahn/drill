Apache Drill 0.5.0, the first beta release for Drill, is designed to help
enthusiasts start working and experimenting with Drill. It also continues the
Drill monthly release cycle as we drive towards general availability.

The 0.5.0 release is primarily a bug fix release, with [more than 100 JIRAs](h
ttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12313820&versi
on=12324880) closed, but there are some notable features. For information
about the features, see the [Apache Drill Blog for the 0.5.0
release](https://blogs.apache.org/drill/entry/apache_drill_beta_release_see).

This release is available as [binary](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/inc
ubator/drill/drill-0.5.0-incubating/apache-drill-0.5.0-incubating.tar.gz) and 
[source](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/drill/drill-0.5.0-incu
bating/apache-drill-0.5.0-incubating-src.tar.gz) tarballs that are compiled
against Apache Hadoop. Drill has been tested against MapR, Cloudera, and
Hortonworks Hadoop distributions. There are associated build profiles and
JIRAs that can help you run Drill against your preferred distribution.

Apache Drill 0.5.0 Key Notes and Limitations

  * The current release supports in memory and beyond memory execution. However, you must disable memory-intensive hash aggregate and hash join operations to leverage this functionality.
  * While the Drill execution engine supports dynamic schema changes during the course of a query, some operators have yet to implement support for this behavior, such as Sort. Others operations, such as streaming aggregate, may have partial support that leads to unexpected results.
  * There are known issues with joining text files without using an intervening view. See [DRILL-1401](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-1401) for more information.
