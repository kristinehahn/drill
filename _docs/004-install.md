title: "Install Drill"
---
You can install Drill in embedded mode or in distributed mode. Installing
Drill in embedded mode does not require any configuration, which means that
you can quickly get started with Drill. If you want to use Drill in a
clustered Hadoop environment, you can install Drill in distributed mode.
Installing in distributed mode requires some configuration, however once you
install you can connect Drill to your Hive, HBase, or distributed file system
data sources and run queries on them.
