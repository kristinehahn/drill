This tutorial introduced Apache Drill and its ability to run ANSI SQL queries
against various data sources, including Hive tables, MapR-DB/HBase tables, and
file system directories. The tutorial also showed how to work with and
manipulate complex and multi-structured data commonly found in Hadoop/NoSQL
systems.

Now that you are familiar with different ways to access the sample data with
Drill, you can try writing your own queries against your own data sources.
Refer to the [Apache Drill documentation](/drill/docs) for more information.
