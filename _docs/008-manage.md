title: "Manage Drill"
---
When using Drill, you may need to stop and restart a Drillbit on a node, or
modify various options. For example, the default storage format for CTAS
statements is Parquet. You can modify the default setting so that output data
is stored in CSV or JSON format.

You can use certain SQL commands to manage Drill from within the Drill shell
(SQLLine). You can also modify Drill configuration options, such as memory
allocation, in Drill's configuration files.
