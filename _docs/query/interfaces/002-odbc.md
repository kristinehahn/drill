MapR provides ODBC drivers for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It is recommended
that you install the latest version of Apache Drill with the latest version of
the Drill ODBC driver.

For example, if you have Apache Drill 0.5 and a Drill ODBC driver installed on
your machine, and then you upgrade to Apache Drill 0.6, do not assume that the
Drill ODBC driver installed on your machine will work with the new version of
Apache Drill. Install the latest available Drill ODBC driver to ensure that
the two components work together.

You can access the latest Drill ODBC drivers in the following location:

information, as well as examples for connecting to BI tools:
